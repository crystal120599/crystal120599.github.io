        <p>
            <!--Hello, my name is Crystal Chavez. I am a student at College of the Canyons (Class of 2021) and plan on transferring to CSU Northridge. I'm currently on my way into
            becoming a web developer as I pursue my BS in Computer Science. I got into web development senior year in high school and took it seriously midway of 2019, and now
            have a years experience of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Once was a member of Girls Who Code @Canyon High School, I was able to learn web dev through codeacademy and
            freecodecamp.-->
