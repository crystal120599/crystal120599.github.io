            Hello, my name is <strong>Crystal Chavez</strong>. I am a student at College of the Canyons (Class of 2021) and plan on transferring to CSU Northridge for the school year 2021-2022.
            I'm currently on my way into becoming a web developer as I pursue my BS in Computer Science. Once was a member of Girls Who Code at Canyon High School, I was able to 
            learn web dev through codeacademy, w3schools, and freecodecamp. Now I am part of the virtual CSU Stanislaus Computer Science club, we are currently doing workshops and projects.
            I got into web development senior year in high school and took it seriously midway of 2019, and now have more experience in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Besides my love
            for CS,I do enjoy reading books and comics, love to play video games especially First Person Shooter games, and spending time with the family.
            </p>
